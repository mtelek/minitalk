## ‚ú® Description
Minitalk is a small data exchange program that demonstrates communication between a client and a server using UNIX signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2).  
The server receives and displays strings sent by the client, with the communication happening exclusively through signals.  
This project showcases low-level inter-process communication in a Unix environment.

## Key Features
- Client-server architecture using UNIX signals
- Efficient transmission of strings between processes
- Supports multiple consecutive client connections
- Fast performance (100+ characters per second)
- Server acknowledgment signals
- Unicode character support

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Compilation
1, Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mtelek/minitalk.git
cd minitalk
```
2, Compile the project
```bash
make
```
This will create two executables: server and client.

## üöÄ Usage
1, First, start the server in one terminal:
```bash
./server
```
The server will display its PID which you'll need for the client.  
2, In another terminal, use the client to send messages:
```bash
./client [server-pid] "your message here"
```
3, The server will display received messages in real-time.

## üß™ Automated Testing
You can test the project using the [Minitalk-Tester](https://github.com/ThibaudM13/minitalk-Tester) by [ThibaudM13](https://github.com/ThibaudM13?tab=overview&from=2025-07-01&to=2025-07-23).  
This tester helps verify the functionality and performance of the implementation of the project.
